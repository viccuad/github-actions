# Kubewarden GitHub Actions

This is a collection of GitHub Actions to help with Kubewarden and Kubewarden
policies. It contains:
- GitHub Actions in the root of the repo. Normally not consumed by end users.
- Reusable workflows for policy testing and release, that make use of the
  mentioned GitHub Actions.

### Versioning

`v2` and upwards are under semver tags, following ["using tags for release
management"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#using-tags-for-release-management).

`v1` is under the v1 branch, following ["using branches for release
management"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#using-branches-for-release-management).

### Releasing a new tag

1. Tag your release with a semver tag (e.g: `v2.3.0`).

2. Refresh the major tag (e.g: `v2`) to point to the latest version
   corresponding to that major version. E.g: if `v2.3.0` is the last release of
   the `v2` major version, both `v2` and `v2.3.0` tags should be pointing to the
   same commit.
   .
   When consuming GitHub Actions they don't automatically select the major or
   minor version for you, hence why we need to update the major tag.
   .
   Note that we are ourselves consumers of our own GHA in this repo, as we
   consume the actions in the reusable workflows.
